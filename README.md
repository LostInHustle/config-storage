# Command Storage

This repository is used to store all the hidden files from my home directory. It helps in keeping track of configuration files, preferences, and other settings that are typically hidden in Unix-like systems (those starting with a dot `.`).

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to store the following types of hidden files:

- Configuration files for various tools and services.
- Shell history files, like `.zsh_history` and `.bash_history`.
- Settings files for various applications such as `.zprofile`, `.zshrc`, and `.gitconfig`.
- Temporary or system-generated files like `.DS_Store`, `.Trash`, and `.ServiceHub`.

By storing these files in this repository, I can easily manage, back up, and synchronize them across different environments.

## Files Stored

Here are some of the types of files included in this repository:

- `.idlerc` - Configuration for the IDLE Python environment.
- `.zsh_history` - History of commands used in the Z shell.
